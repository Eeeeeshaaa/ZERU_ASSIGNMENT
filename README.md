# ZERU_ASSIGNMENT
Building a machine learning model to assign wallet credit scores (0â€“1000) using only historical Aave V2 transaction data.

----OBJECTIVE----
The project aims to assign a credit score (0-1000) to each wallet interacted with the Aave V2 protocol. The scoring is purely based on the previous transactions made whose data is received from the json file.

---METHODOLODY---
I used a heuristic based approach to solve the problem to ensure transparency and extensibility.

****KEY FEATURES EXTRACTED PER WALLET****
1.total_deposit
2.total_redeem
3.net_balance
4.num_transactions
5.active_days
6.duration_days

-----PROCESSING FLOW-------
1.INPUT-Take the JSON input data from Aave V2.
2.PREPROCESSING-Parse and normalize the data.
3.FEATURE EXTRACTION-Aggregate wallet-transactions.
4.SCORING-Use a weighted formula to get final score.
5.OUTPUT-Saved in a .csv file.
